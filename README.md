# clumsyMIDI
A Raspberry Pi expansion board containing a MIDI interface, DAC, and OLED display requiring only through-hole soldering skills. This is primarily intended as an all-in-one hardware solution for the mt32-pi Roland MT-32 emulator but all features are usable with Raspberry Pi OS, too.

## Features
* TI PCM5102 I2S HiFi DAC (using the ubiquitous GY-PCM5102 carrier board)
* GPIO MIDI interface with in, out, and thru
* 0.91" OLED display
* works with mt32-pi and Linux
* no SMT soldering required, suitable for DIY electronics beginners and clumsy people ;)
