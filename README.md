# clumsyMIDI
A Raspberry Pi expansion board containing a MIDI interface, DAC, and OLED display requiring only through-hole soldering skills. This is primarily intended as an all-in-one hardware solution for the [mt32-pi Roland MT-32 emulator](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi) but all features are usable with Raspberry Pi OS, too.

## Features
* TI PCM5102 I2S HiFi DAC (using the ubiquitous GY-PCM5102 carrier board)
* GPIO MIDI interface with in, out, and thru
* 0.91" OLED display
* large-ish 5V bypass capacitor which may help with slightly weak power supplies
* works with [mt32-pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi) and Raspberry Pi OS
* no SMT soldering required, so it should be suitable for clumsy DIYers like me ;)

## Schematic and BOM
Schematic and BOM are available in the [`pdf/` subfolder](https://github.com/gmcn42/clumsyMIDI/tree/main/pdf).

## How to get the PCB
You can get a zip file with the Gerber files from the [releases page](https://github.com/gmcn42/clumsyMIDI/releases/) and let your favorite board house build the PCB. Alternatively, you can also order directly from PCBWAY via [this link](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/clumsyMIDI___Raspberry_Pi_expansion_board.html) for convenience. Full disclosure: If you use the link, PCBWAY will donate 10% of the PCB price to me. I want to make clear that the PCB design is completely free and you are in no way obligated or even encouraged to use that link.

In case you want to make changes to the PCB before ordering somewhere, you can use [KiCAD](https://kicad.org/) and import the project.

## Assembly
As all components are through-hole, you should get by with basic soldering skills. It is usually the best idea to start with the flattest components and work your way up. The 40-Pin GPIO socket should be soldered on last, also remember that it goes on the *bottom* :).

As shown in the BOM, I recommend socketing U1 and U2 as they are the most likely casualties if defective MIDI devices are connected for some reason. Be mindful of the ICs' orientation. The notch of the 74HCT14 should be where the notch is on the silkscreen. Likewise, the H11L1's dot (marking for Pin 1) should also face the in the direction of the notch on the silkscreen. If inserted correctly, U1 and U2 will "face outward and away from each other".

It is possible to leave out some components, e.g. if you only need MIDI-In. Consult [the schematic](https://github.com/gmcn42/clumsyMIDI/blob/main/pdf/clumsyMIDI-schematic.pdf) for details.

In standard configuration, the MIDI Thru output is available on a 5-pin header due to space constraints. If you do not need MIDI Out but want a MIDI Thru, it is possible to route the Thru signal to the MIDI-Out socket instead of the pin header. In that case, leave J4, R1, and R5 unpopulated and solder a wire between the footprint pads of J4 and R1 marked with a circle on the silkscreen, as shown in these two pictures (click for larger version):

Be sure to use some kind of standoffs or similar when connecting clumsyMIDI to the PI. Without them, the board may sit lopsided and come in contact with the HDMI port, potentially causing a short circuit. Apart from that, it's more mechanically stable and simply looks nicer :). The BOM contains the brass standoffs I am using in the pictures.

A final general note: Use caution and common sense while working with electronics, especially while soldering stuff. As stated in the license, I am offering this PCB design as-is incuding any and all defects it may have and will not be held liable for any harm that comes to you or others as a result of using/building/looking at it.

## Software Config
### mt32-pi
Follow the setup instructions on their site and then set the following options in `mt32-pi.cfg`:
```
usb = off
output_device = i2s
type = ssd1306_i2c
```
The option `gpio_thru` will also work with the MIDI Out port on clumsyMIDI, so use at your preference.

### Raspberry Pi OS
You need to add the following to `/boot/config.txt` to get GPIO MIDI, I2S DAC, and I2C support
```
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt
dtoverlay=midi-uart0

dtparam=i2s=on
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac

dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
```
Also you need to comment out or remove the line `dtparam=audio=on`

To get regular ALSA MIDI support you need to bridge `/dev/ttyAMA0` and an ALSA MIDI port. You can do this with [`ttymidi`](https://github.com/cjbarnes18/ttymidi).

The I2C display is supported by the [Adafruit SSD1306 Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306.git), among others.

Have fun!
